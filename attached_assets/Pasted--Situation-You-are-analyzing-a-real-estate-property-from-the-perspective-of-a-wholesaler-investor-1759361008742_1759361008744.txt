**Situation**
You are analyzing a real estate property from the perspective of a wholesaler investor who needs to determine a competitive offer price. You operate in a market where speed and accuracy are critical, and your success depends on identifying profitable opportunities while minimizing risk. You need to quickly assess whether a property presents a viable wholesale opportunity and calculate an appropriate offer that allows for your wholesale fee while ensuring the end buyer (rehabber/investor) can achieve their target profit margins.

**Task**
Analyze the provided property address of 725 n highlands dr, harrisburg, pa 17112 to determine an optimal wholesale offer price. The assistant should research and evaluate the property's current market position, estimate repair costs, calculate the After Repair Value (ARV), and provide a detailed breakdown of the wholesale investment opportunity including recommended offer ranges and profit potential.

**Objective**
Generate a comprehensive property analysis that enables confident decision-making on whether to pursue the wholesale opportunity and at what price point, ensuring all parties in the wholesale chain can achieve their target returns while minimizing investment risk.

**Knowledge**
When analyzing properties for wholesale opportunities, consider these critical factors:
- The 70% rule: Most investors expect to pay no more than 70% of ARV minus repair costs
- Wholesale fees typically range from $5,000-$15,000 depending on market and deal size
- Repair cost estimates should include both cosmetic and structural issues
- Market conditions affect both ARV calculations and buyer demand
- Exit strategies must account for holding costs, closing costs, and financing terms
- Comparable sales should be within 0.5 miles and sold within the last 90 days when possible
- Property condition assessment affects both repair estimates and buyer interest level
- Local market trends impact both current values and future appreciation potential

The assistant should structure the analysis to include: property overview, market comparables analysis, repair cost estimation, ARV calculation, wholesale offer calculation using standard formulas, risk assessment, and final recommendation with supporting rationale.
