Of course. After a thorough analysis of your codebase, I've pinpointed the root cause of the "undefined" phone number issue. It's a multi-step problem originating from a mismatch between your database schema and your application code, which then causes incorrect data to be sent to the frontend.

Here is a complete breakdown of the problem and the steps to fix it.

The Core Problem: Database Schema Mismatch
The fundamental issue is a discrepancy in your contacts database table. Your application code expects a column named phone, but your actual database schema has a column named phone_e164.

This is confirmed by the error message you provided: error: column "phone_e164" of relation "contacts" does not exist.

This error occurs in server/lead-delivery.ts when the application tries to save new leads to the database. Because the phone column doesn't exist, the entire contact insertion fails silently within a try...catch block. Consequently, no phone numbers are ever saved or associated with the property, and the frontend receives an empty or incorrect data structure.

The Solution: A Step-by-Step Fix
We will address this by correcting the schema, ensuring the backend code is aligned, and then verifying the frontend code.

Step 1: Correct the Database Schema
First, you need to align your application's schema definition with the intended database structure. The most direct way to fix this is to update your Drizzle schema definition to use phone instead of phone_e164.

Action:

In WholesaleFlow/shared/schema.ts, modify the contacts table definition to ensure the phone column is correctly defined.

TypeScript

// WholesaleFlow/shared/schema.ts

export const contacts = pgTable("contacts", {
  id: varchar("id")
    .primaryKey()
    .default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`),
  propertyId: varchar("property_id"),
  name: text("name").notNull(),
  phone: text("phone"), // This is the correct column name
  email: text("email"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});
After making this change, you will need to generate and apply a new database migration.

Bash

npx drizzle-kit generate
This will create a new SQL migration file that renames the column in your database from phone_e164 to phone.

Step 2: Ensure Correct Data Insertion in the Backend
Your backend code in server/lead-delivery.ts is already attempting to insert into the phone column, which is correct. The issue was that the column didn't exist with that name. Once the migration from Step 1 is complete, the existing code will work as intended.

Here is the relevant (and now correct) code block from server/lead-delivery.ts:

TypeScript

// server/lead-delivery.ts

// ... inside savePropertyWithSchema function

      // 4. Insert/get contacts - with field validation
      if (leadData.ownerPhone || leadData.ownerEmail) {
        try {
          // Insert contact with current schema fields
          await db
            .insert(contacts)
            .values({
              propertyId: propertyId,
              name: leadData.ownerName || "Unknown Owner",
              phone: leadData.ownerPhone || null, // This will now work correctly
              email: leadData.ownerEmail || null,
            })
            .onConflictDoNothing();
          console.log("✅ Contact saved successfully");
        } catch (contactError: any) {
          console.log("⚠️ Contact insert failed:", contactError.message);
          // Skip contact creation if it fails
        }
      }
No changes are needed here, but it's important to understand this is where the original error was occurring.

Step 3: Verify Frontend Data Handling
Finally, ensure the frontend components correctly handle and display the phone number data. The PropertyDetailsModal component in chat-interface.tsx should use the robust formatPhoneNumbers function to handle various formats. The corrected function you were given previously is the right approach.

Here is the corrected formatPhoneNumbers function again for completeness:

TypeScript

// WholesaleFlow/client/src/components/chat/chat-interface.tsx

// ... inside PropertyDetailsModal component

  const formatPhoneNumbers = (property: any) => {
    const uniquePhones = new Set<string>();

    // Helper to add a phone number to the set after cleaning
    const addPhone = (phone: any) => {
      if (typeof phone !== 'string' || !phone || phone.toLowerCase() === 'null' || phone.toLowerCase() === 'undefined') {
        return;
      }
      const digits = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
      if (digits.length >= 10) {
        uniquePhones.add(digits);
      }
    };

    // 1. Check for primary phone fields
    addPhone(property.ownerPhone);
    addPhone(property.ownerMobilePhone);
    addPhone(property.ownerLandLine);

    // 2. Process the ownerPhoneNumbers array
    if (Array.isArray(property.ownerPhoneNumbers)) {
      property.ownerPhoneNumbers.forEach((phoneEntry: any) => {
        if (typeof phoneEntry === 'string') {
          addPhone(phoneEntry);
        } else if (typeof phoneEntry === 'object' && phoneEntry?.number) {
          addPhone(phoneEntry.number);
        }
      });
    }
    
    // 3. (Fallback) Check for nested owner object properties
    if (property.owner) {
        addPhone(property.owner.phone);
        if(Array.isArray(property.owner.phoneNumbers)) {
            property.owner.phoneNumbers.forEach((phone: any) => addPhone(phone.number || phone));
        }
    }

    if (uniquePhones.size === 0) {
      return "Contact for details";
    }

    const formattedPhones = Array.from(uniquePhones).map(digits => {
      if (digits.length === 10) {
        return `(${digits.slice(0, 3)}) ${digits.slice(3, 6)}-${digits.slice(6)}`;
      }
      return digits;
    });

    return formattedPhones.join(", ");
  };
Summary of the Flow and Fix
The Error: The application tried to save a phone number to a phone column that was actually named phone_e164 in the database, causing the save operation to fail.

The Consequence: No contact information was ever saved for new leads.

The Symptom: The frontend received incomplete data and tried to display phone numbers from an empty or invalid array, resulting in the "undefined (undefined)" output.

The Solution: By correcting the schema with a new migration, the backend can now save contact information correctly. With valid data flowing to the frontend, the UI components will render the phone numbers as expected.

By following these steps, you will resolve the issue at its source and ensure a consistent and reliable flow of data from the backend to the user interface.
